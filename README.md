# New Lou's List

## Description
New Lou's List application picks up where the old Lou's List left off, implementing the same useful features and building more to help students and faculty 
manage their schedules. Users can now create an account, search for any classes UVA is offering, and add classes to their cart to create multiple schedules.
## Instructions
### Sign up
To start, create a user with your Google login credentials via the button on the top right in the navigation bar.
Next, fill in the sign-up page and submit to complete the process.
### Search for classes 
To search for classes, locate the advanced search bar under the menu at the top left of the page or use the quick search bar at the top right.
At the results page, you can add any class desired by using the "Add to Cart" button located at the bottom of that classes section.
To remove any section of class from your cart, simply click the "Remove from Cart" button in the same location.
### Create and edit a Schedule
To create a schedule, navigate to either the user dashboard page or the schedule builder page, both found on the menu in the top left of the navigation bar.
After clicking the "Create a new schedule" button, enter the schedule name and associated semester and color.
To edit a schedule, select it in the schedule builder page.
Add classes on the left side by finding it in your cart and using the plus button and remove them in the calendar section by pressing the x in the top right of the class block.
### Update User Profile
You can alter your user profile information by navigating to the "Account Settings" page displayed in the dropdown on the left side of the application.
From there, you can choose your profile image from the given options, change your first and last name or username, and add a major and graduation year.
To save the settings, click the "Update Account Settings" button at the bottom. 
### Social Page and Friends
New Lou's List allows users to view their friend's newly created schedules and share their own. 
To find friends, navigate to the Social page and search for friends on the right hand side using their username.
After adding a friend, you can now view all their recently created schedules in the social page and leave comments on their post. 
You can also share your created schedules by setting the schedule's visibility to "Public" or "Friends Only", while the "Private" option makes it only visible to you.
